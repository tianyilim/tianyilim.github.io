<h2>About Me</h2>
I am a third year BEng Electrical and Information Engineering (or, Computer Engineering) student at Imperial College London. I will be continuing my studies at ETH Zurich, doing a MSc in Robotics, Systems, and Control.

Robotics has always been my passion since I picked it up in high school - there is something fascinating about being able to impart intelligence to otherwise inanimate objects, allowing them to perform useful tasks and potentially replace humans.

In my spare time, I enjoy dreaming up (and sometimes building) robots, some of which are showcased in my [Portfolio](portfolio.md) collection. I also occasionally take [photos](photog.md).
