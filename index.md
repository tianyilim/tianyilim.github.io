<h2>About</h2>

I am a robotics R&D engineer at [DSO National Labs](https://www.dso.org.sg/) in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬, working on localization and state estimation for a variety of different robots.

I completed a MSc in [Robotics, Systems, and Control](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/engineering-sciences/robotics-systems-and-control.html) at ETH Zurich in 2024. Before that, I completed a BEng in [Electronic and Information Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/electronic-information-meng/) (or, Computer Engineering) at Imperial College London in 2022.

Robotics has always been my passion since I picked it up in high school - there is something fascinating about being able to impart intelligence to otherwise inanimate objects, allowing them to perform useful tasks and potentially replace humans.

In my spare time, I enjoy dreaming up (and sometimes building) robots, some of which are showcased in my [Portfolio](portfolio.md) collection. I also occasionally take [photos](photog.md).
