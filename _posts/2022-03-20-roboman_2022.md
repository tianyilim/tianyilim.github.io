This coursework was done as part of the Robotic Manipulation module in Imperial College, taught by [Dr Ad Spiers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ad-spiers-37228027/).

I did it with my groupmates [Alexander Pondaven](https://github.com/alexpondaven) and [Peter (Shuanghua) Liu](https://github.com/shl2019).

The coursework involved use of the ROBOTIS [Dynamixel OpenManipulator-X](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/overview/) 4DOF Robot Arm. The robots were programmed in MATLAB.

Do look through our [report](https://github.com/alexpondaven/RoboMan/blob/main/RM%20Report%20-%20BOB.pdf) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/alexpondaven/RoboMan).

## Forward and Inverse Kinematics

The Denavitâ€“Hartenberg (DH) parameters were used to model the forward kinematics (FK) of the robot. This is a convention that allows the transformation between the different coordinate frames that make up the robot to be defined.

In this case, as with most robotics applications (including ROS), the "right-hand" convention is followed, where coordinate frames look like this. Furthermore, by convention, $x$ is coloured red, $y$ green, and $z$ blue.

DH tables are comprised of the 4 DH parameters - $d$, the offset along 

A DH table was derived and can be found in the report. This allowed the robot to be simulated graphically in MATLAB:
