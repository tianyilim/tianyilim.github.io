# Reinforcement Learning for drones with the Robotics and Perception Group

I participated in the ["Vision-based Drone Flight"](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/teaching.html) course by the Robotics and Perception Group (RPG) at the University of Zurich. In short, we used their SotA simulator and infrastructure to play around with a RL policy to control drones!

RPG has been working on agile drone flight for quite some time, and has even developed a RL-based drone pilot that rivals professional human pilots on a fixed drone racing course. We used the simulator and associated machinery for this to develop a RL policy for a "camera drone" to track an "actor drone" -- think about what a DJI drone can do, autonomously following and filming a person /thing.

The final task was for our "camera" drone to detect the "actor" drone with some sort of YOLO model, which would give a bounding box as input to the RL policy. The policy would then automatically track the actor drone as it moved around the environment. In practice, due to the short 1-week long nature of the course, our group only managed to get the camera drone to follow the actor drone when fed with the ground-truth state of the actor drone.

This was quite an interesting experience. We learned about how important reward shaping is to RL policies. The RL algorithms are not *very* complicated, but the machinery around them -- simulators, dashboards, validation... getting those right, and *fast*, is a core part of enabling the impressive results of RL research.

The course was quite intensive, but we had some time to fool around...

Here is a video of our policy tracking the actor drone (with blue LEDs).

For those maybe interested, we did a report which perhaps explains the details a little better:
