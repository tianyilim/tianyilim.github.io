## Distributed Multi-Robot Trajectory Planning in a Warehouse Environment

My Final Year Project at Imperial College was a multi-robot trajectory planner. I was supervised by [Professor Andrew Davison](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/index.html).

I used the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) as a Local Planner, coupled with Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) as a Global Planner.

The simulation environment was done in ROS2 Galactic, with a simulation environment created in Gazebo.

Initially, I wanted to make the [Eurobot competition](eurobot_2022) my focus, but hardware limitations (we didn't have a working robot ðŸ˜”) meant that I had to change tack to something more simulation-focused.

I tried to create my own version of an Amazon warehouse, complete with robots inspired by the Amazon Pegasus Robots:

    <br>
    <i>Top View of my own robots</i>
</p>

Through the project, I learnt a _lot_ about ROS and Gazebo, implementing many things from scratch. It has left me feeling accomplished, but bittersweet - ROS is so powerful, but developing on it really is a *pain*.

(More content detailing exactly what I did will come *soon*!)

Here's looking forward to developing and deploying ROS to a physical robot!
