# tianyilim.github.io

A simple website following Jekyll's documentation, to showcase my work.

Jekyll [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs) is available here.

GitHub pages [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) is available here.

Things to improve:
- Adding nice formatting to the photos page - perhaps ordering it in grid form?
- Adding something that parses the attached image json file to show caption and locations, without hashtags.
