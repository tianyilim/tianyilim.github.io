A simple website following Jekyll's documentation, to showcase my work.

Jekyll [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs) is available here.

GitHub pages [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) is available here.

Remember to run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to test locally.

Things to improve:
- Edit Portfolio page to use its own styling (instead of `page` styling). This styling could list out all the elements from `posts->portfolio` with a nicely-formatted title and header image, like what's being done for posts on the front page.
