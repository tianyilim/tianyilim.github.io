Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of the things I've worked on, roughly ordered in order of coolness.

I always try to learn something new in each of these projects, and most of the time I do.

Hopefully these projects inspire you to do something cool of your own.

If you have any questions about these projects, I would love to get in touch!

Mostly for my convenience, here are some of my config files: [tmux](assets/tmux.conf)
