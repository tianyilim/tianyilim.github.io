Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of the things I've worked on, roughly ordered in order of coolness.

I always try to learn something new in each of these projects, and most of the time I do.

Hopefully these projects inspire you to do something cool of your own.

If you have any questions about these projects, I would love to get in touch!

Mostly for my convenience, here are some of my config files: [tmux](assets/tmux.conf)

#### [F1Tenth with ETH(2023-2024)](forzaETH)

Participating in robotics competitions has always been important to me -- I've done it in one way or another since high school. I had the privillege of competing in another autonomous driving competition, for 1/10 scale RC cars. Initially, I focused more on robust localizaiton, but subsequently dabbled in improving our trajectory planning and perception.

Our *ForzaETH* team has been very successful, earning 1st and 3rd places in the 2023 and 2024 international competitions at ICRA.

#### [Pose Graph Optimization for large-scale SLAM (2024)](master_thesis)

Master's Thesis with the Computer Vision and Geometry Group, ETH. Open source Visual SLAM solutions don't really scale to very large (~1h+) trajectories due to the worst-case cubic complexity of pose graph optimization in the number of poses, and scaling issues on map storage size. We proposed some methods to get around this.

#### [Basic RL for vision-based drone flight (2024)](rpgDroneCourse)

A cool intensive course by the Robotics and Perception Group, UZH. We applied basic RL algorithms in simulation and on real drones, on the task of controlling a drone to visually film / track a target.

#### [Perception for Big Autonomous Trucks (2023)](embotechInternship)

I helped to develop perception systems for autonomous trucks in a 6-month internship with [Embotech](https://www.embotech.com/).

#### [Eurobot Competition (2022)](eurobot_2022)
A competition with the Imperial College Robotics Society.

Two robots were built in *3 weeks*!
